This repository hosts the source code for my personal blog website [https://azurewithaj.com](https://azurewithaj.com), which is hosted on GitHub Pages.

The website is built using Jekyll, a static site generator, and is based on the [Mediumish for Jekyll](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish) theme.
