<p>Welcome to my blog! I’m an Azure, DevOps and AI enthusiast with over 15 years of industry experience. My deep technical expertise lies in infrastructure and DevOps, specialising in the automation and development of cloud services and modernisation for enterprise clients.</p>

<p>I have a strong focus on Microsoft technologies and a passion for designing and implementing robust cloud solutions. I thrive on driving CI/CD pipelines and managing infrastructure as code. Enhancing the developer experience and giving back to the community are close to my heart. I contribute to open-source projects, speak at user groups, and engage wherever I can.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, I’m a typical nerd and a big Star Wars fan. When I’m not immersed in Azure or GitHub, I love sharing my other passions with family and friends.</p>
